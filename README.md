# Hangman-Game

This is my take on the hangman game. In short, the program reads an external file called "Words.txt," Loads all of the words in the file into an arraylist and then uses a random generator to pick one of the words within the array. 

I chose to use an arraylist because of how easily it makes adding/deleting words.

I plan to add a way for the user to ask for hints once they make two incorrect guesses.
